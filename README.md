[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MarijaStanojcic/MovieRecommendation/master)

This is my first project learning about recommendation systems. Currently, there are some simple algorithms for popularity model, user similarity and item similarity model. This is still work in progress.

The data is downloaded from the https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/

These files contain 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000.

Book used as a help for this project is Recommendation Systems with Python by Rounak Banik from Packt.
